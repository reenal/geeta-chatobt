0,what is the meaning of true happiness?,"True happiness doesn't lie in external achievements or possessions, but in the inner state of self-realization and freedom from desires and attachments.

Shloka: सुखेन न विजानाति किञ्चिदिह किन्तु नूनम्।
त्वमेवैकं त्वमेवैकं त्वमेवैकं त्वं विद्धि ॥ (Bhagavad Gita 6.22)

Meaning: ""He who finds happiness within himself, who is active within himself, and who finds satisfaction within himself, that yogi, being Brahman, attains eternal peace.""

Explanation: This shloka emphasizes that true happiness is an internal state, not dependent on external factors. It is achieved through self-realization and detachment from desires.

Example: Imagine a person who finds joy in helping others without seeking anything in return. Their happiness stems from within, from the act of giving, not from any external reward or recognition. This is a glimpse of true happiness.

When a person is actually in the\nknowledge that Kåñëa is the fountainhead  of everything, then when he acts in\nthat spirit he acts for every one. The sufferings of humanity are due to\nforgetfulness of Kåñëa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the\nsupreme friend. Therefore, to act to revi ve this consciousness within the entire\nhuman society is the highest welfare work. One cannot  be engaged in such\nfirst-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A Kåñëa\nconscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of Kåñëa. He has no doubt\nbecause he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love.\nA person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human\nsociety cannot factually help anyone. Te mporary relief of the external body\nand the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one’s difficulties in the hard\nstruggle for life may be fo und in one’s forgetfulness of his relationship with the\nSupreme Lord. When a man is fully cons cious of his relationship with Kåñëa,\nhe is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle.\nTEXT  26\nk-aMa§-aeDaivMau¢-aNaa& YaTaqNaa& YaTaceTaSaaMa( )\nAi>aTaae b]øiNavaR<a& vTaRTa e ividTaaTMaNaaMa( )) 26 ))\nkäma-krodha-vimuktänäà\nyaténäà yata-cetasäm\nabhito brahma-nirväëaà\nvartate viditätmanäm\nSYNONYMS\nkäma —from desires; krodha —and anger; vimuktänäm —of those who are\nliberated; yaténäm —of the saintly persons; yata-cetasäm —who have full\ncontrol over the mind; abhitaù —assured in the near future;\nbrahma-nirväëam —liberation in the Supreme; vartate —is there;\nvidita-ätmanäm —of those who are self-realized.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.\nPURPORT\nBeing engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand\none’s spiritual identity, and then on e can understand the Supreme Lord by\nmeans of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service,\none comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation\nin the Supreme.\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the\nLord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by\nthe practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible\ninto an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,\npratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of\nyoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily\nexplained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,\ntaste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of\nthe eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose\nwith half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because\nthen there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does\nnot risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.\nTEXT  29\n>aae¢-ar& YajTaPaSaa& SavRl/aek-MaheìrMa( )\nSauôd& SavR>aUTaaNaa& jaTva Maa& XaaiNTaMa*C^iTa )) 29 ))\nbhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà\nsarva-loka-maheçvaram\nsuhådaà sarva-bhütänäà\njïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati\nSYNONYMS\nbhoktäram —the beneficiary; yajïa —of sacrifices; tapasäm —and penances and\nausterities; sarva-loka —of all planets and the demigods thereof;\nmahä-éçvaram —the Supreme Lord; su-hådam —the benefactor; sarva —of all;\nbhütänäm —the living entities; jïätvä —thus knowin g; mäm —Me (Lord\nKåñëa); çäntim —relief from material pangs; åcchati —one achieves.\nTRANSLATION\nA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

**Meaning:** ""Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna, perform your duty and abandon attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.""

**Example:** Imagine a gardener tending to their garden. They water the plants, nurture the soil, and protect them from pests, not attached to whether they will bear fruit immediately or at all. Their focus is on the act of caring, finding peace in fulfilling their duty. This is how you can find peace even amidst chaos.

Real desirelessness is desire\nfor the satisfaction of Kåñëa, not an ar tificial attempt to abolish desires. The\nliving entity cannot be desireless or sens eless, but he does have to change the\nquality of the desires. A mater ially desireless person certainly knows that\neverything belongs to Kåñëa ( éçäväsyam idaà sarvam ), and therefore he does\nnot falsely claim proprietorship over an ything. This transcendental knowledge\nis based on self-realization—namely, knowing perfectly wel l that every living\nentity is an eternal part and parcel of Kåñëa in spiritual identity, and that the\neternal position of the living entity is  therefore never on the level of Kåñëa or\ngreater than Him.

When a person is actually in the\nknowledge that Kåñëa is the fountainhead  of everything, then when he acts in\nthat spirit he acts for every one.

Therefore, to act to revi ve this consciousness within the entire\nhuman society is the highest welfare work. One cannot  be engaged in such\nfirst-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A Kåñëa\nconscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of Kåñëa.

One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.\nPURPORT\nBeing engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand\none’s spiritual identity, and then on e can understand the Supreme Lord by\nmeans of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service,\none comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation\nin the Supreme.\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the\nLord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by\nthe practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible\ninto an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,\npratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of\nyoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily\nexplained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,\ntaste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of\nthe eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose\nwith half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because\nthen there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does\nnot risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.\nTEXT  29\n>aae¢-ar& YajTaPaSaa& SavRl/aek-MaheìrMa( )\nSauôd& SavR>aUTaaNaa& jaTva Maa& XaaiNTaMa*C^iTa )) 29 ))\nbhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà\nsarva-loka-maheçvaram\nsuhådaà sarva-bhütänäà\njïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati\nSYNONYMS\nbhoktäram —the beneficiary; yajïa —of sacrifices; tapasäm —and penances and\nausterities; sarva-loka —of all planets and the demigods thereof;\nmahä-éçvaram —the Supreme Lord; su-hådam —the benefactor; sarva —of all;\nbhütänäm —the living entities; jïätvä —thus knowin g; mäm —Me (Lord\nKåñëa); çäntim —relief from material pangs; åcchati —one achieves.\nTRANSLATION\nA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

Therefore one should worship the Supreme L ord with His\nenergies. Generally the Vaiñëava devot ees worship the Supreme Lord with His\ninternal energy. His external energy is  a perverted reflection of the internal\nenergy. The external energy is a back ground, but the Supreme Lord by the\nexpansion of Hi s plenary portion as Paramätmä is situated everywhere. He is\nthe Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One\nshould therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has hisCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.duty to render service unto the Supreme . Everyone should be engaged in\ndevotional service to the Lord in  full Kåñëa consciousness. That is\nrecommended in this verse.\nEveryone should think that he is enga ged in a particular type of occupation\nby Håñékeça, the master of the senses. And by the result of the work in which\none is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, should be\nworshiped. If one thinks alwa ys in this way, in full Kåñëa consciousness, then,\nby the grace of the Lord, he becomes fu lly aware of everything. That is the\nperfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä  (12.7), teñäm ahaà\nsamuddhartä.  The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of deliv ering such a\ndevotee. That is the highest perfection of life.

 ""avyayam —everlasting.\nTRANSLATION\nThis knowledge is the king of education,  the most secret of all secrets. It is\nthe purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by\nrealization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully\nperformed.\nPURPORT\nThis chapter of Bhagavad-gétä  is called the king of education because it is\nthe essence of all doctrines and phil osophies explained before. Among the\nprincipal philosophers in India are Gautama, Kaëäda, Kapila, Yäjïavalkya,\nÇäëòilya and Vaiçvänara. And fin ally there is Vyäsadeva, the author of the\nVedänta-sütra.  So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or\ntranscendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the\nking of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge t hat can be derived\nfrom the study of the Vedas  and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most\nconfidential because confidential or  transcendental knowledge involves\nunderstanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of\nall confiden tial knowledge culminates in devotional service.\nGenerally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are\neducated in external knowledge. As fa r as ordinary education is concerned,\npeople are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics,\nchemistry, mathematics, astro nomy, engineering, etc. There are so many\ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but\nthere is, unfortunately, no university  or educational institution where the\nscience of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part\nof the body; without the presence of th e soul, the body has no value. Still\npeople are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for\nthe vital soul.\nThe Bhagavad-gétä,  especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.importance of the soul. In the very begi nning, the Lord says that this body is\nperishable and that the soul is not perishable ( antavanta ime dehä nityasyoktäù\nçarériëaù ). That is a conf idential part of knowledge:  simply knowing that the\nspirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable,\nindestructible and eternal. But that gi ves no positive information about the\nsoul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from\nthe body and that when the body is fini shed, or one is liberated from the body,\nthe soul remains in a void and becomes im personal. But actually that is not the\nfact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inact ive after\nbeing liberated from the body? It is always  active. If it is eternal, then it is\neternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most\nconfidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are\ntherefor e indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most\nconfidential part of all knowledge.\nThis knowledge is the purest form of  all activities, as explained in Vedic\nliterature. In the Padma Puräëa,  man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and\nare shown to be the results of sin afte r sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive\nactivities are entang led in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For\ninstance, when the seed of a particular  tree is sown, the tree does not appear\nimmediately to grow; it takes some time. It  is first a small, sprouting plant, then\nit assumes the form of a tree, the n it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is\ncomplete, the flowers and fruits are en joyed by persons who have sown the\nseed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs  a sinful act, and like a seed it takes\ntime to fructify. There are different stages. The sin ful action may have already\nstopped within the individual, but the resu lts or the fruit of that sinful action\nare still to be enjoyed. There are sins wh ich are still in the form of a seed, and\nthere are others which are already fructified and are giving us  fruit, which we\nare enjoying as distress and pain.\nAs explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter , a person\nwho has completely ended the reactions of  all sinful activities and who is fully\nengaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world,\nbecomes engaged in d evotional service to the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead, Kåñëa. In other words, th ose who are actually engaged in theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.devotional service of the Supreme Lord  are already freed from all reactions.\nThis statement is confirmed in the Padma Puräëa:\naprärabdha-phalaà päpaà\nküöaà béjaà phalonmukham\nkrameëaiva praléyeta\nviñëu-bhakti-ratätmanäm\nFor those who are engaged in the de votional service of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, all sinful reacti ons, whether fructified, in the stock, or\nin the form of a seed, gradually vani sh. Therefore the purifying potency of\ndevotional service is very str ong, and it is called pavitram uttamam,  the purest.\nUttama  means transcendental. Tamas  means this material world or darkness,\nand uttama  means that which is transcende ntal to material activities.\nDevotional activities are never to be considered material, a lthough sometimes\nit appears that devotees are engaged ju st like ordinary men. One who can see\nand is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material\nactivities. They are all spiritual an d devotional, uncontaminated by the\nmaterial mo des of nature.\nIt is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can\nperceive the results directly. This direct  result is actually perceived, and we\nhave practical experience that any pers on who is chanting the holy names of\nKåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Ha re Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare\nRäma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels\nsome transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material\ncontamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in\nhearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well,\nor if he engages himself in helpin g the missionary activities of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in\nspirit ual life does not depend on an y kind of previous education or\nqualification. The method itself is so pu re that by simply engaging in it one\nbecomes pure.\nIn the Vedänta-sütra  (3.2.26 ) this is also described in the following words:\nprakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät.  “Devotional service is so potent that simply byCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.engaging in the activities of devoti onal service one becomes enlightened\nwithout a doubt.” A practica l example of this can be seen in the previous life\nof Närada, who in that life happened to  be the son of a maidservant. He had\nno education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was\nengaged in serving great devotees, Närada also became e ngaged, and\nsometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees\nhimself. Närada personally says,\nucchiñöa-lepän anumodito dvijaiù\nsakåt sma bhuïje tad-apästa-kilbiñaù\nevaà pravåttasya viçuddha-cetasas\ntad-dharma evätma-ruciù prajäyate\nIn this verse from Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.5.25 ) Närada describes his previous\nlife to his disciple Vyäsadeva. He says  that while engaged as a boy servant for\nthose purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately\nassociating with the m. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their\ndishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the\nremnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they\ngave it Närada ate those remnants and consequently be came freed from all\nsinful reactions. As he went on eating , he gradually became as pure-hearted as\nthe sages. The great devotees relished th e taste of unceasing devotional service\nto the Lord by hearing and chanting, and Närada gradually developed the\nsame  taste. Närada says further,\ntatränvahaà kåñëa-kathäù pragäyatäm\nanugraheëäçåëavaà manoharäù\ntäù çraddhayä me ’nupadaà viçåëvataù\npriyaçravasy aìga mamäbhavad ruciù\nBy associating with the sages, Närada got the taste for hearing and chanting\nthe glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service.\nTherefore, as described in the Vedänta-sütra,  prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät:  if\none is engaged simp ly in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed\nto him automatically, and he can understand. This is called pratyakña,  directlyCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.perceived.\nThe word dharmyam  means “the path of religion.” Närada was actually a\nson of a maidservant. He had no opport unity to go to school. He was simply\nassisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the\ndevotees. The child Närada also g ot the opportunity and simply by association\nachieved the highest goal of all religi on. The highest goal of all religion is\ndevotional service, as stated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (sa vai puàsäà paro\ndharmo yato bhaktir adhokñaje ). Religious people generally do  not know that\nthe highest perfection of religion is th e attainment of devotional service. As\nwe have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight ( vedeñu\nyajïeñu tapaùsu caiva ), generally Vedic knowledge is required for\nself-realization.  But here, although Närada never went to the school of the\nspiritual master and was not educated in  the Vedic principles, he acquired the\nhighest results of Vedic study. This pr ocess is so potent that even without\nperforming the religious process regularly , one can be raised to the highest\nperfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature:""
 'intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.\nPURPORT\nBéjam  means seed; Kåñëa is the seed of everything. There are various living\nentities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures\nare moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert—they cannot\nmove, but only stand. E very entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000\nspecies of life; some of them are moving  and some of them are inert. In all\ncases, however, the seed of their life is  Kåñëa. As stated in Vedic literature,\nBrahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is th at from which everything is\nemanating. Kåñëa is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal\nand Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal  Brahman is situated in the personal\naspect—that is stated in Bhagavad-gétä.  Therefore, originally, Kåñëa is the\nsource of everything. He is the root. As  the root of a tree maintains the whole\ntree, Kåñëa, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this\nmaterial manifestation. This is also confirmed in the Vedic literature ( Kaöha\nUpaniñad  2.2.13 ):\nnityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm\neko bahünäà yo vidadhäti kämän\nHe is the prime eternal among all eter nals. He is the supreme living entity\nof all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life.

Although the li ving entities are part of His energies\nand are therefore divine, due to contac t with material energy their original\nsuperior power is covered. Be ing thus covered by material energy, one cannot\npossibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and\nspiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead,\nare eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal  superior nature of the\nLord, but due to contamination by the in ferior nature, matter, their illusion is\nalso eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha,  or eternally\nconditioned. No one can trace out th e history of his becoming conditi oned at a\ncertain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of\nmaterial nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an\ninferior energy, because material ener gy is ultimately conducted by the\nsupreme will, which  the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material\nnature is defined herein as divine na ture due to its divine connection and\nmovement by the divine will.

3,how can I balance my personal and professional life?,"To balance your personal and professional life, see them not as two, but as different facets of the same diamond – your Dharma.  Just as a chariot master controls his horses with skill, balance comes from fulfilling your duties with focused attention, without being consumed by their outcomes.

Shloka: **योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय। सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते।। (2.48)**

Meaning:  ""Be steadfast in Yoga, O Arjuna, perform your duty and abandon attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity in action is called Yoga.""

Example: A musician practices diligently, not solely for fame or wealth, but for the love of music itself. This dedication to their craft, regardless of the outcome, brings balance and fulfillment. Similarly, approach your duties with focused attention and skillful execution, finding joy in the process itself, and balance will naturally follow.

The varëäçrama  religion’s principles\nwere so designed that the good popula tion would prevail in society for the\ngeneral spiritual progress of stat e and community. Such population depends on\nthe chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to\nbe misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both\nchildren and women require protection by the elder members o f the family. By\nbeing engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into\nadultery. According to Cäëakya Paëòita, women are generally not very\nintelligent and therefore not trustworthy.  So the different family traditions of\nreligious act ivities should always engage th em, and thus their chastity and\ndevotion will give birth to a good popula tion eligible for participating in the\nvarëäçrama  system. On the failure of such varëäçrama-dharma,  naturally the\nwomen become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in\nat the risk of unwanted population.

All Rights Reserved.PURPORT\nArjuna submitted three different questions , and the Lord answers them one\nafter another. In these verses, Kåñëa first indicates that a person\ntranscendentally situated has no envy  and does not hanker for anything.\nWhen a living entity stays in this materia l world embodied by the material\nbody, it  is t o be underst ood t h at  h e is under the control of one of the three\nmodes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out\nof the clutches of the material mo des of nature. But as long as he is not out of\nthe material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the\ndevotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will\nautomatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he\nacts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to\nKåñëa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material\nbody, and he does not need to accept th e dictations of the material body. The\nqualities of the material modes i n the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is\naloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to\nenjoy the body, nor does he desire to  get out of it. Thus transcendentally\nsituated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become\nfree from the influence of the modes of material nature.\nThe next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated\nperson. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and\ndishonor offered to the body, but the tr anscendentally situated person is not\naffected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kåñëa\nconsciousness and does not mind whethe r a man honors or dishonors him. He\naccepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise\nhe has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or g old. He takes\neveryone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Kåñëa\nconsciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed\nand sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he\nhas nothing to d o with material existence. Social and political issues do not\naffect him, because he knows the si tuation of temporary upheavals and\ndisturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attemptCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.anything for Kåñëa, but for his personal self he  does not attempt anything.

As explained before, the material\nworld is acting under the spell of the mo des of material nature. One should not\nbe disturbed by the activitie s of the modes of nature; instead of putting his\nconsciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kåñëa\nactivities. Kåñëa activities are known as bhakti-yoga —always acting for Kåñëa.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.This includes not only Kåñëa, but His different p lenary expansions such as\nRäma and Näräyaëa. He has innumerabl e expansions. One who is engaged in\nthe service of any of the forms of Kå ñëa, or of His plenary expansions, is\nconsidered to be transcendentally situat ed. One should also note that all the\nforms  of Kåñëa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal.\nSuch personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they\npossess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of\nKåñëa or His plenary expans ions with unfailing determination, although these\nmodes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome\nthem easily. This has alre ady been explained in the Seventh Chapter . One\nwho surrenders unto Kåñëa at on ce surmounts the influence o f the modes of\nmaterial nature. To be in Kåñëa consciousness or in devotional service means\nto acquire equality with Kåñëa. The Lo rd says that His nature is eternal,\nblissful and full of knowledge, and the livi ng entities are part and parcel of the\nSupreme , as gold particles are part of a gold  mine. Thus the living entity, in his\nspiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference\nof individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of\nbhakti-yoga.  Bhakti-yoga  mea ns that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and\nthe activity of exchange of love betw een the Lord and the devotee is there.\nTherefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise  there would be\nno meaning to bhakti-yoga.  If one is not situated in the same transcendental\nposition with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal\nassistant to a king, one must acquire th e qualifications. Thus the qualification\nis to become Brahman, or freed from all ma terial contamination. It is said in\nthe Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahmäpy eti.  One can attain the Supreme\nBrahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively\nbecome one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his\neternal Brahman identity as an individual soul.\nTEXT  27\nb]ø<aae ih Pa[iTaïahMaMa*TaSYaaVYaYaSYa c )Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l.

Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.\nParamätmä, the Supersoul, is the middl e, the second stage in transcendental\nrealization, and the Supreme Personali ty of Godhead is the ultimate realization\nof the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramätmä and the impersonal\nBrahman are within the Supreme Pe rson. It is explained in the Seventh\nChapter  that material nature is the manife station of the inferior energy of the\nSupreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with\nfragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material\nnature. When a living entity conditione d by this material nature begins the\ncultivation of spiritual  knowledge, he elevates himself from the position ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the\nSupreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage\nin self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-rea lized person is transcendental\nto the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.\nIf he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then\ngradually rise up to Paramätmä realization and then to the realization of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic\nliterature. The four Kumäras were situ ated first in the impersonal Brahman\nconception of truth, but then they grad ually rose to the platform of devotional\nservice. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of\nBrahman runs the risk of falling down. In Çrémad-Bhägavatam  it is stated that\nalthough a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going\nfurther, with no information of the Supreme Perso n, his intelligence is not\nperfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform,\nthere is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional\nservice of the Lord. In the Vedic  language it is also said, raso vai saù, r asaà hy\neväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati:  “When one understands the Personality of\nGodhead, the reservoir of pleasure, Kåñëa, he actually becomes\ntranscendentally blissful.” ( Taittiréya Upaniñad  2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full\nin six opulences, and when a devot ee approaches Him there is an exchange of\nthese six opulences.

When a person is actually in the\nknowledge that Kåñëa is the fountainhead  of everything, then when he acts in\nthat spirit he acts for every one. The sufferings of humanity are due to\nforgetfulness of Kåñëa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the\nsupreme friend. Therefore, to act to revi ve this consciousness within the entire\nhuman society is the highest welfare work. One cannot  be engaged in such\nfirst-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A Kåñëa\nconscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of Kåñëa. He has no doubt\nbecause he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love.\nA person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human\nsociety cannot factually help anyone. Te mporary relief of the external body\nand the mind is not satisfactory.

One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.\nPURPORT\nBeing engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand\none’s spiritual identity, and then on e can understand the Supreme Lord by\nmeans of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service,\none comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation\nin the Supreme.\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the\nLord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by\nthe practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible\ninto an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,\npratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of\nyoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily\nexplained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,\ntaste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of\nthe eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose\nwith half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because\nthen there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does\nnot risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.\nTEXT  29\n>aae¢-ar& YajTaPaSaa& SavRl/aek-MaheìrMa( )\nSauôd& SavR>aUTaaNaa& jaTva Maa& XaaiNTaMa*C^iTa )) 29 ))\nbhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà\nsarva-loka-maheçvaram\nsuhådaà sarva-bhütänäà\njïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati\nSYNONYMS\nbhoktäram —the beneficiary; yajïa —of sacrifices; tapasäm —and penances and\nausterities; sarva-loka —of all planets and the demigods thereof;\nmahä-éçvaram —the Supreme Lord; su-hådam —the benefactor; sarva —of all;\nbhütänäm —the living entities; jïätvä —thus knowin g; mäm —Me (Lord\nKåñëa); çäntim —relief from material pangs; åcchati —one achieves.\nTRANSLATION\nA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

Real desirelessness is desire\nfor the satisfaction of Kåñëa, not an ar tificial attempt to abolish desires. The\nliving entity cannot be desireless or sens eless, but he does have to change the\nquality of the desires. A mater ially desireless person certainly knows that\neverything belongs to Kåñëa ( éçäväsyam idaà sarvam ), and therefore he does\nnot falsely claim proprietorship over an ything.

One should not come under the control of such\nattachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization.\nPURPORT\nThose who are in Kåñëa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in\nmaterial sense gratification. But those who are not in such consciousness\nshould follow the rules and regulations of  the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted\nsense enjoyment is the caus e of material encagement, but one who follows the\nrules and regulations of the revealed sc riptures does not become entangled by\nthe sense objects. For example, se x enjoyment is a necessity for the\nconditioned soul, and sex enjo yment is allowed under the li cense of marriage\nties. According to scriptural injunction s, one is forbidden to engage in sex\nrelationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to\nbe considered as one’s mother. But in sp ite of such injunctions, a man is still\ninclin ed to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\nnot rely upon the control of such allo wances. One has to follow those rules and\nregulations, unattached to them, becaus e practice of sense gratification under\nregulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as t here is always the\nchance of an accident, even on the ro yal roads. Although they may be very\ncarefully maintained, no one can guaran tee that there will be no danger evenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long,\nlong time , owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense\nenjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment\nfor regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But\nattachment to Kåñëa consciousness, or ac ting always in the loving service of\nKåñëa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one\nshould try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life. The\nwhole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately\nto become situated on the platform of Kåñëa consciousness.\nTEXT  35\né[eYaaNSvDaMaaeR ivGau<a"" ParDaMaaRTSvNauiïTaaTa( )\nSvDaMaeR iNaDaNa& é[eYa"" ParDaMaaeR >aYaavh"" )) 35 ))\nçreyän sva-dharmo viguëaù\npara-dharmät sv-anuñöhität\nsva-dharme nidhanaà çreyaù\npara-dharmo bhayävahaù\nSYNONYMS\nçreyän —far better; sva-dharmaù —one’s prescribed duties; viguëaù —even\nfaulty; para-dharmät —than duties mentioned for others;\nsu-anuñöhität —perfectly done; sva-dharme —in one’s prescribed duties;\nnidhanam —destruction; çreyaù —better; para-dharmaù —duties prescr ibed for\nothers; bhaya-ävahaù —dangerous.\nTRANSLATION']",0.8,0.15788641044114127,0.9999999999666667
5,how can I cultivate gratitude and contentment?,"Cultivate gratitude by recognizing that everything you have is a gift, and contentment by focusing on what you already possess, rather than yearning for what you lack.

Shloka: यद्रच्छालाभसंतुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः ।
समः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते ॥ (4.22)

Meaning: One who is content with whatever he obtains by the grace of God, who is free from duality, envy, and anxiety, and who is the same in success and failure, is not bound by karma even after performing action.

Example: A farmer who, despite unpredictable weather, remains grateful for the sunshine and rain, content with whatever his harvest yields, embodies this principle. He understands that he has done his duty and accepts the outcome with a peaceful mind.

The varëäçrama  religion’s principles\nwere so designed that the good popula tion would prevail in society for the\ngeneral spiritual progress of stat e and community. Such population depends on\nthe chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to\nbe misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both\nchildren and women require protection by the elder members o f the family. By\nbeing engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into\nadultery. According to Cäëakya Paëòita, women are generally not very\nintelligent and therefore not trustworthy.  So the different family traditions of\nreligious act ivities should always engage th em, and thus their chastity and\ndevotion will give birth to a good popula tion eligible for participating in the\nvarëäçrama  system. On the failure of such varëäçrama-dharma,  naturally the\nwomen become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in\nat the risk of unwanted population.

When a person is actually in the\nknowledge that Kåñëa is the fountainhead  of everything, then when he acts in\nthat spirit he acts for every one.

One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.\nPURPORT\nBeing engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand\none’s spiritual identity, and then on e can understand the Supreme Lord by\nmeans of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service,\none comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation\nin the Supreme.\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the\nLord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by\nthe practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible\ninto an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,\npratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of\nyoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily\nexplained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,\ntaste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of\nthe eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose\nwith half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because\nthen there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does\nnot risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.\nTEXT  29\n>aae¢-ar& YajTaPaSaa& SavRl/aek-MaheìrMa( )\nSauôd& SavR>aUTaaNaa& jaTva Maa& XaaiNTaMa*C^iTa )) 29 ))\nbhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà\nsarva-loka-maheçvaram\nsuhådaà sarva-bhütänäà\njïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati\nSYNONYMS\nbhoktäram —the beneficiary; yajïa —of sacrifices; tapasäm —and penances and\nausterities; sarva-loka —of all planets and the demigods thereof;\nmahä-éçvaram —the Supreme Lord; su-hådam —the benefactor; sarva —of all;\nbhütänäm —the living entities; jïätvä —thus knowin g; mäm —Me (Lord\nKåñëa); çäntim —relief from material pangs; åcchati —one achieves.\nTRANSLATION\nA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

For himself there was no desire to fight, but for\nKåñëa the same A rjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire\nfor the satisfaction of Kåñëa, not an ar tificial attempt to abolish desires. The\nliving entity cannot be desireless or sens eless, but he does have to change the\nquality of the desires. A mater ially desireless person certainly knows that\neverything belongs to Kåñëa ( éçäväsyam idaà sarvam ), and therefore he does\nnot falsely claim proprietorship over an ything. This transcendental knowledge\nis based on self-realization—namely, knowing perfectly wel l that every living\nentity is an eternal part and parcel of Kåñëa in spiritual identity, and that the\neternal position of the living entity is  therefore never on the level of Kåñëa or\ngreater than Him.

**Shloka:** वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि। तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही।। (2.22)

**Meaning:** Just as a person discards worn-out clothes and wears new ones, the soul similarly discards worn-out bodies and takes on new ones.

**Explanation:** This shloka emphasizes the distinction between the eternal soul and the temporary body.  The soul, being eternal,  continuously transmigrates from one body to another, just as we change clothes. Recognizing this truth is fundamental to understanding the purpose of life, which is to transcend this cycle of reincarnation and attain liberation.

**Example:** Imagine a person living in a series of temporary houses.  Each house represents a lifetime. The person may decorate and become attached to each house, but eventually, they have to move on to the next.  Similarly, we take on different bodies throughout our journey, but our true self, the soul, remains constant. The purpose is to realize this truth and strive for liberation, which is like finding a permanent abode beyond these temporary dwellings.

One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.\nPURPORT\nBeing engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand\none’s spiritual identity, and then on e can understand the Supreme Lord by\nmeans of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service,\none comes to the transcendental pos ition, qualified to feel the presence of the\nLord in the sphere of one’s activity. This  particular position is called liberation\nin the Supreme.\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the\nLord gives instruction to Arjuna as to  how one can come to that position by\nthe practice of the mysticism or yoga known as añöäìga-yoga,  which is divisible\ninto an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma,\npratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna  and samädhi.  In the Sixth Chapter the subject of\nyoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily\nexplained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form,\ntaste and smell by the pratyähära  process in yoga,  and then keep the vision of\nthe eyes between the two eyebrows an d concentrate on the tip of the nose\nwith half-closed lids. There is no benefi t in closing the eyes altogether, because\nthen there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening theCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense\nobjects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by\nneutralizing the up-moving a nd down-moving air within the body. By practice\nof such yoga one is able to gain control over  the senses, refrain from outward\nsense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger\nand thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In\nother words, Kåñëa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga\nprinciples. This will be thor oughly explained in the next chapter. A Kåñëa\nconscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does\nnot risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of\ncontrolling the senses than by the añöäìga-yoga.\nTEXT  29\n>aae¢-ar& YajTaPaSaa& SavRl/aek-MaheìrMa( )\nSauôd& SavR>aUTaaNaa& jaTva Maa& XaaiNTaMa*C^iTa )) 29 ))\nbhoktäraà yajïa-tapasäà\nsarva-loka-maheçvaram\nsuhådaà sarva-bhütänäà\njïätvä mäà çäntim åcchati\nSYNONYMS\nbhoktäram —the beneficiary; yajïa —of sacrifices; tapasäm —and penances and\nausterities; sarva-loka —of all planets and the demigods thereof;\nmahä-éçvaram —the Supreme Lord; su-hådam —the benefactor; sarva —of all;\nbhütänäm —the living entities; jïätvä —thus knowin g; mäm —Me (Lord\nKåñëa); çäntim —relief from material pangs; åcchati —one achieves.\nTRANSLATION\nA person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimateCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

Nonbelievers in the existence\nof the soul are calle d atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for\nargument’s sake, we accept this atheis tic theory, there is still no cause for\nlamentation. Apart from the separate  existence of the soul, the material\nelements remain unmanifested before creation. F rom this subtle state of\nnonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated;\nfrom air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth\nbecomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take\nplace. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it\nis dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as\natoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in\ncourse of time things a re manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference.\nThen what cause is there for lamentatio n either in the stage of manifestation\nor in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage,\nthings are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain\nunmanifested, and only in the middle ar e they manifested, and this does not\nmake any real material difference.\nAnd if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gétä  that\nthese material bodies are perishable in due course of time ( antavanta ime\ndehäù ) but that the soul is eternal ( nityasyoktäù çarériëaù ) ,  t h e n  w e  m u s t\nremember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the\nchanging of a dress?

In a dream we may think of\nflying in the sky, or sitting on  a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can\nsee that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot.

Men\nwith a poor fund of kn owledge and men who are not austere cannot\nunderstand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it\nis explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even\nto Brahmä, the first living being in the universe. Owi ng to a gross material\nconception of things, most men in th is age cannot imagine how such a small\nparticle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper\nas wonderful either by constitution or  by description. Illusioned by the\nmateri al energy, people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense\ngratification that they have very littl e time to understand the question of\nself-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this\nself-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for\nexistence. Perhaps they have no idea th at one must think of the soul, and thus\nmake a solution to the material miseries.\nSome people who are inclined to he ar about the soul may be attending\nlectures, in good association, but some times, owing to ignorance, they are\nmisguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without\ndistinction of magnitude. It is very  difficult to find a man who perfectly\nunderstands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective\nfunctions and relationships and all othe r major and minor details.

But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the\nsubject matter of the soul, then one’s life is successful.\nThe easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is\nto accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gétä  spoken by the greatest authority,\nLord Kåñëa, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a\ngreat deal of penance  and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones,\nbefore one is able to accept Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nKåñëa can, however, be known as such  by the causeless mercy of the pure\ndevotee and by no other way.\nTEXT  30\ndehq iNaTYaMavDYaae_Ya& dehe SavRSYa >aarTa )\nTaSMaaTSavaRi<a >aUTaaiNa Na Tv& XaaeicTauMahRiSa )) 30 ))\ndehé nityam avadhyo ’yaà\ndehe sarvasya bhärata\ntasmät sarväëi bhütäni\nna tvaà çocitum arhasi\nSYNONYMS\ndehé—the owner of the material body; nityam —eternally; avadhyaù —cannot\nbe killed; ayam —this soul; dehe—in the body; sarvasya —of everyone;\nbhärata —O descendant of Bharata; tasmät —therefore; sarväëi —all;\nbhütäni —living entities (that are born); na—never; tvam—you; çocitum —to\nlament; arhasi —deserve.\nTRANSLATION\nO descendant of Bharata, he who dw ells in the body can never be slain.\nTherefore you need not grieve for any living being.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

The sense of an\nexistence separate from Kåñëa is called mäyä  (mä—not, yä—this). Some think\nthat we have nothing to do with Kåñëa,  that Kåñëa is only a great historical\npersonality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is\nstated in the Bhagavad-gétä,  this impersonal Brahman is the personal\neffulgence of Kåñëa. Kåñëa, as the Su preme Personality of Godhead, is the\ncause of everything. In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the ca use of all causes. Even the millions of\nincarn ations are only His different expans ions. Similarly, the living entities\nare also expansions of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that\nKåñëa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought\nis material in nature. We have e xperience in the material world that a thing,\nwhen fragmentally distributed, lose s its own original identity. But the\nMäyävädé philosophers fail to understand that absolute  means that one plus\none is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to on e. This is the\ncase in the absolute world.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now\ncovered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa.\nAlthough we are separated parts of Kåñëa, we are nevertheless not different\nfrom Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is mäyä,  or not actual\nfact. We are all meant to satisfy Kåñëa. By mäyä  alone Arjuna thought that the\ntemporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his\neternal spiritual relationship with Kåñëa. The whole tea ching of the Gétä is\ntargeted toward this end: that a livi ng being, as Kåñëa’s eternal servitor,\ncannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from\nKåñëa is called mäyä.  The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the\nSupreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Ha ving forgotten that purpose since time\nimmemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods,\netc. Such bodily differences arise fr om forgetfulness of the transcendental\nservice of the Lord. But w hen one is engaged in transcendental service\nthrough Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion.\nOne can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master\nand thereby avoid the delusion  that the living entity i s equal to Kåñëa. Perfect\nknowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is the supreme shelter for all living\nentities, and giving up such shelter, th e living entities are deluded by the\nmaterial energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus,  under\ndifferent standards of material identi ty, they become forgetful of Kåñëa.\nWhen, however, such deluded living en tities become situated in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, it is to be understood th at they are on the path of liberation, as\nconfirmed in the Bhägava tam (2.10.6 ): muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa\nvyavasthitiù.  Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional position as\nan eternal servitor of Kåñëa (Kåñëa consciousness).\nTEXT  36\nAiPa cediSa PaaPae>Ya"" SaveR>Ya"" PaaPak*-taMa"" )\nSav| jaNaâveNaEv v*iJaNa& SaNTairZYaiSa )) 36 ))\napi ced asi päpebhyaùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

The senses require real engagements,\nand if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,\nthey will certainly seek engag ement in the service of materialism. In the\nmaterial world everyone, including Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä—to say\nnothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets—is subjected to the\ninfluence of sense objects, and the on ly method to get out of this puzzle of\nmaterial existence is to become Kåñë a conscious. Lord Çiva was deep in\nmeditation, but when Pärvaté agitated hi m for sense pleasure, he agreed to the\nproposal, and as a result Kärtikeya wa s born. When Haridäsa Öhäkura was a\nyoung devotee of the Lord, he  was similarly allured by the incarnation of\nMäyä-devé, but Haridäsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed\ndevotion to Lord Kåñëa.

On the other hand, a person  in Kåñëa consciousness knows how to\nuse everything in the service of the Lord; ther efore he does not become a\nvictim of material consciousness. For ex ample, for an impersonalist, the Lord,\nor the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries\nto avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kåñëa is the supreme enjoye r and\nthat He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good\neatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasädam.  Thus\neverything becomes spiritualized, and th ere is no danger of a downfall. The\ndevotee takes prasäda m in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee\nrejects it as material.

These are transcendental, beyond both body\nand mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice\nof the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga.  In each of these processes one has to\nrealize the constitutional positi on of the living entity, his relationship with\nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve\nthe highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the\nabove-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner\nor later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter : even a little\nendeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out\nof these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga  is especially suitable for this\nage because it is the most direct meth od of God realization. To be doubly\nassured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One\nmay sincerely accept the path of self-rea lization, but the process of cultivation\nof knowledge and the practic e of the eightfold yoga system are generally very\ndifficult for this age. Therefore, desp ite constant endeavor one may fail, for\nmany reasons. First of all, one may no t be sufficiently serious about followingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the\nclutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various\nallurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of m aterial\nenergy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while\nperforming transcendental disciplines.

Those who are materialists have no interest\nin transcendence; therefore they are mo re interested in material advancement\nby economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by\nappropriate work. When one takes to t he path of transcendence, one has to\ncease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material\nhappiness. If the aspiring transcendentalis t fails, then he apparently loses both\nways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness  nor spiritual\nsuccess.

The sense of an\nexistence separate from Kåñëa is called mäyä  (mä—not, yä—this). Some think\nthat we have nothing to do with Kåñëa,  that Kåñëa is only a great historical\npersonality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is\nstated in the Bhagavad-gétä,  this impersonal Brahman is the personal\neffulgence of Kåñëa. Kåñëa, as the Su preme Personality of Godhead, is the\ncause of everything. In the Brahma-saàhitä  it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the ca use of all causes. Even the millions of\nincarn ations are only His different expans ions. Similarly, the living entities\nare also expansions of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that\nKåñëa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought\nis material in nature. We have e xperience in the material world that a thing,\nwhen fragmentally distributed, lose s its own original identity. But the\nMäyävädé philosophers fail to understand that absolute  means that one plus\none is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to on e. This is the\ncase in the absolute world.Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now\ncovered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa.\nAlthough we are separated parts of Kåñëa, we are nevertheless not different\nfrom Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is mäyä,  or not actual\nfact. We are all meant to satisfy Kåñëa. By mäyä  alone Arjuna thought that the\ntemporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his\neternal spiritual relationship with Kåñëa. The whole tea ching of the Gétä is\ntargeted toward this end: that a livi ng being, as Kåñëa’s eternal servitor,\ncannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from\nKåñëa is called mäyä.  The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the\nSupreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Ha ving forgotten that purpose since time\nimmemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods,\netc. Such bodily differences arise fr om forgetfulness of the transcendental\nservice of the Lord. But w hen one is engaged in transcendental service\nthrough Kåñëa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion.\nOne can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master\nand thereby avoid the delusion  that the living entity i s equal to Kåñëa. Perfect\nknowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kåñëa, is the supreme shelter for all living\nentities, and giving up such shelter, th e living entities are deluded by the\nmaterial energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus,  under\ndifferent standards of material identi ty, they become forgetful of Kåñëa.\nWhen, however, such deluded living en tities become situated in Kåñëa\nconsciousness, it is to be understood th at they are on the path of liberation, as\nconfirmed in the Bhägava tam (2.10.6 ): muktir hitvänyathä-rüpaà svarüpeëa\nvyavasthitiù.  Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional position as\nan eternal servitor of Kåñëa (Kåñëa consciousness).\nTEXT  36\nAiPa cediSa PaaPae>Ya"" SaveR>Ya"" PaaPak*-taMa"" )\nSav| jaNaâveNaEv v*iJaNa& SaNTairZYaiSa )) 36 ))\napi ced asi päpebhyaùCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

The\ndevotee takes prasäda m in Kåñëa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee\nrejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his\nartificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls\nhim down again into the pool of material  existence. It is said that such a soul,\neven though rising up to the point of li beration, falls down again due to his not\nhaving support in devotional service.\nTEXT  64\nraGaÜezivMau¢E-STau ivzYaaiNaiNd]YaEêrNa( )\nAaTMavXYaEivRDaeYaaTMaa Pa[SaadMaiDaGaC^iTa )) 64 ))\nräga-dveña-vimuktais tu\nviñayän indriyaiç caran\nätma-vaçyair vidheyätmä\nprasädam adhigacchati\nSYNONYMS\nräga—attachment; dveña —and detachment; vimuktaiù —by one who has\nbecome free from; tu—but; viñayän —sense objects; indriyaiù —by the senses;\ncaran —acting upon; ätma-vaçyaiù —under one’s control; vidheya-ätmä —one\nwho follows regulated freedom; prasädam —the merc y of the Lord;Copyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

There are many so-called\nspiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly  or\nprivately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are\nunable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his\nlong association with material nature, he is in bondage. Kåñëa consciousness\nhelps one to get out of t he material entanglement, even though one may be\nengaged in his prescribed duties in te rms of material existence. Therefore,\nwithout being fully in Kåñëa consciousness, one should not give up his\noccupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his pres cribed duties and\nbecome a so-called yogé or transcendentalist artificially.

One should not come under the control of such\nattachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization.\nPURPORT\nThose who are in Kåñëa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in\nmaterial sense gratification. But those who are not in such consciousness\nshould follow the rules and regulations of  the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted\nsense enjoyment is the caus e of material encagement, but one who follows the\nrules and regulations of the revealed sc riptures does not become entangled by\nthe sense objects. For example, se x enjoyment is a necessity for the\nconditioned soul, and sex enjo yment is allowed under the li cense of marriage\nties. According to scriptural injunction s, one is forbidden to engage in sex\nrelationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to\nbe considered as one’s mother. But in sp ite of such injunctions, a man is still\ninclin ed to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\nnot rely upon the control of such allo wances. One has to follow those rules and\nregulations, unattached to them, becaus e practice of sense gratification under\nregulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as t here is always the\nchance of an accident, even on the ro yal roads. Although they may be very\ncarefully maintained, no one can guaran tee that there will be no danger evenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long,\nlong time , owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense\nenjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment\nfor regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But\nattachment to Kåñëa consciousness, or ac ting always in the loving service of\nKåñëa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one\nshould try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life. The\nwhole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately\nto become situated on the platform of Kåñëa consciousness.\nTEXT  35\né[eYaaNSvDaMaaeR ivGau<a"" ParDaMaaRTSvNauiïTaaTa( )\nSvDaMaeR iNaDaNa& é[eYa"" ParDaMaaeR >aYaavh"" )) 35 ))\nçreyän sva-dharmo viguëaù\npara-dharmät sv-anuñöhität\nsva-dharme nidhanaà çreyaù\npara-dharmo bhayävahaù\nSYNONYMS\nçreyän —far better; sva-dharmaù —one’s prescribed duties; viguëaù —even\nfaulty; para-dharmät —than duties mentioned for others;\nsu-anuñöhität —perfectly done; sva-dharme —in one’s prescribed duties;\nnidhanam —destruction; çreyaù —better; para-dharmaù —duties prescr ibed for\nothers; bhaya-ävahaù —dangerous.\nTRANSLATION'

A transc endentalist is supposed to give up all\nmaterial activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, KåñëaCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousne ss one may attain the\nhighest perfection if it is completed,  but if one does not attain such a\nperfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined\nin the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing\nprescri bed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental\nactivities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bhägavatam\nassures the unsuccessful transcendentalis t that there need be no worries. Even\nthough he may be subjected to the reacti on for not perfectly executing\nprescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness\nis never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is\nlowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follow s strictly\nthe prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is\nlacking in Kåñëa consciousness.\nThe purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into\ntwo sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are\nengaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next\nlife or spiritual salvation belong  to the nonregulated section. And those who\nfollow the principles of prescribed du ties in the scriptures are classified\namongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and\nnoncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are  full of animal\npropensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the\nanimal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually\nremain in material existence, which is  always miserable. On the other hand,\nthose who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually\nto Kåñëa consciousness, certainly progress in life.\nThose who are following the path of  auspiciousness can be divided into\nthree sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who\nare enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate\nliberation from material exi stence, and (3) those who are devotees in Kåñëa\nconsciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the\nscriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those\nwho are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.\nThose who are after fruitive results for se nse gratification may be elevated to aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

Activity in Kåñëa\nconsciousne ss is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily\naccepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of\nKåñëa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe\nausterity.

Example: Imagine a musician solely focused on fame and fortune. Their creativity becomes stifled, burdened by the desire for external validation.

Therefore, one must control  the mind by\nengaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless\none is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind.

These are transcendental, beyond both body\nand mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice\nof the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga.  In each of these processes one has to\nrealize the constitutional positi on of the living entity, his relationship with\nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve\nthe highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the\nabove-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner\nor later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter : even a little\nendeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out\nof these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga  is especially suitable for this\nage because it is the most direct meth od of God realization. To be doubly\nassured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One\nmay sincerely accept the path of self-rea lization, but the process of cultivation\nof knowledge and the practic e of the eightfold yoga system are generally very\ndifficult for this age. Therefore, desp ite constant endeavor one may fail, for\nmany reasons. First of all, one may no t be sufficiently serious about followingCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war\non the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the\nclutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various\nallurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of m aterial\nenergy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while\nperforming transcendental disciplines. This is called yogäc calita-mänasaù:\ndeviation from the transcendental path . Arjuna is inquisitive to know the\nresults of deviation from the  path of self-realization.\nTEXT  38\nk-iÀàae>aYaiv>a]íiX^àa>a]iMav NaXYaiTa )\nAPa[iTaïae Mahabahae ivMaU!ae b]ø<a"" PaiQa )) 38 ))\nkaccin nobhaya-vibhrañöaç\nchinnäbhram iva naçyati\napratiñöho mahä-bäho\nvimüòho brahmaëaù pathi\nSYNONYMS\nkaccit —whether; na—not; ubhaya —both; vibhrañöaù —deviated from;\nchinna —torn; abhram —cloud; iva—like; naçyati —perishes;\napratiñöhaù —without any position; mahä-bäho —O mighty-armed Kåñëa;\nvimüòhaù —bewildered; brahmaëaù —of transcendence; pathi —on the path.\nTRANSLATION\nO mighty-armed Kåñëa, does not such a man, who is bewildered from the\npath of transcendence, fall away from both spiritual and material success and\nperish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?\nPURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l.

Those who are materialists have no interest\nin transcendence; therefore they are mo re interested in material advancement\nby economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by\nappropriate work. When one takes to t he path of transcendence, one has to\ncease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material\nhappiness. If the aspiring transcendentalis t fails, then he apparently loses both\nways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness  nor spiritual\nsuccess. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky\nsometimes deviates from a small cloud an d joins a big one.

Therefore,\nwithout being fully in Kåñëa consciousness, one should not give up his\noccupational duties.

But those who are not in such consciousness\nshould follow the rules and regulations of  the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted\nsense enjoyment is the caus e of material encagement, but one who follows the\nrules and regulations of the revealed sc riptures does not become entangled by\nthe sense objects. For example, se x enjoyment is a necessity for the\nconditioned soul, and sex enjo yment is allowed under the li cense of marriage\nties. According to scriptural injunction s, one is forbidden to engage in sex\nrelationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to\nbe considered as one’s mother. But in sp ite of such injunctions, a man is still\ninclin ed to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to\nbe curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of\nself-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the\nmaterial body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should\nnot rely upon the control of such allo wances. One has to follow those rules and\nregulations, unattached to them, becaus e practice of sense gratification under\nregulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as t here is always the\nchance of an accident, even on the ro yal roads. Although they may be very\ncarefully maintained, no one can guaran tee that there will be no danger evenCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long,\nlong time , owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense\nenjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment\nfor regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But\nattachment to Kåñëa consciousness, or ac ting always in the loving service of\nKåñëa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one\nshould try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life.

This is not the interaction of the\ntwenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out\nof the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the\nbody, which is a casing made of the twenty-four  elements, and the process of\nknowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the\ndescriptions of the process of knowledge,  the most important point is described\nin the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi cänanya-yogena bhaktir\navyabhi cäriëé:  the process of knowledge term inates in unalloyed devotional\nservice to the Lord. So if one does not a pproach, or is not able to approach, the\ntranscendental service of the Lord, th en the other nineteen items are of no\nparticular value. But if one t akes to devotional service in full Kåñëa\nconsciousness, the other nineteen item s automatically develop within him. As\nstated in Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (5.18.12 ), yasyästi bhaktir bhagavaty akiïcanä\nsarvair guëais tatra samäsate suräù.  All the good qualities of knowledge develop\nin one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.accepting a spiritual master, as mentione d in the eighth verse, is essential.\nEven for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\nTranscendental lif e begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The\nSupreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kå ñëa, clearly states here that this\nprocess of knowledge is the actual path . Anything speculated beyond this is\nnonsense.\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, th e items may be analyzed as follows.\nHumility means that one should not be  anxious to have the satisfaction of\nbeing honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager\nto receive honor from others, b ut from the point of view of a man in perfect\nknowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or\ndishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after\nthis material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion,\nand consequently sometimes it is fo und that without understanding the\nprinciples of religion one enters in to some group which is not actually\nfollowing religious principles and then wa nts to advertise himself as a religious\nmentor. As for a ctual advancement in spiritual sc ience, one should have a test\nto see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean  not killing or destroying the body,\nbut actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in\ngeneral are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they\nperpetually suffer material pain s. So unless one elevates people to spiritual\nknowledge, one is practicing violence. On e should try his best to distribute real\nknowledge to the people, so that they  may become enlightened and leave this\nmaterial entanglement. That is nonviolence.\nTolerance means that one should be pr acticed to bear insult and dishonor\nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge,\nthere will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected\nbecause material nature is so c onstituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only\nfive years old, was engaged in the cu ltivation of spiritual knowledge, was\nendangered when his father became an tagonistic to his devotion. The father\ntried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahläda tolerated him. So there may be\nmany impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but weCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\nSimplicity means that without diplomac y one should be so straightforward\nthat he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the\nspiritual master, that is essential, be cause without the instruction of a bona\nfide spiritual master one  cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should\napproach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so\nthat he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a\nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any\nblessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced\nwithout the disciple’s following the re gulative principles. Or, the regulative\nprinciples will be easier for one wh o has served the spiritual master w ithout\nreservation.\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are\ntwo kinds of cleanliness: external an d internal.

This process cleans the accumulated dust of\npast karma  from the mind.\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in\nspiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\nAnd self-control means that one sh ould not accept anything which is\ndetrimental to the path of spiritual progress.
