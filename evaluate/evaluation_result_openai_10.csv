0,what is the meaning of true happiness?,"True happiness doesn't lie in fleeting pleasures but in inner peace and self-realization. 

Shloka: सुखं त्विदानीं त्रिविधं श्रृणु मे भरतर्षभ |
अभ्यासाद्रमते यत्र दुःखान्तं च निगच्छति || 18.36||

Meaning: O Arjuna, now hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness: The first is that which comes from long practice and delivers from all misery; the second is that in which a man rejoices in the beginning, but which, like poison, ends in pain; and the third appears to be poison at first, but in the end is like nectar.

Example: Imagine a thirsty man in a desert. He sees a mirage and feels initial happiness, but it leads to greater thirst and despair. This is like fleeting pleasure. True happiness is finding an oasis, which requires effort but quenches his thirst permanently. Similarly, lasting happiness comes from spiritual understanding and self-realization, not from chasing temporary pleasures.

 ""entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires,\nbut the Lord is never responsible for th e actions and reactions of the particular\nsituati on which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the\nembodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and\nbecomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life.

2,what is the essence of love?,"The essence of love lies in selfless devotion and complete surrender to the divine. It is a state of being where you act not out of desire for personal gain, but out of pure love and devotion.

> **sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja |ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣhayiṣhyāmi mā śhuchaḥ || 18.66 ||**

**Meaning:** Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.

**Explanation:** This verse beautifully captures the essence of love. When you truly love someone, you surrender your ego and desires, seeking only their well-being. Similarly, in divine love, you surrender all your anxieties and doubts to the Supreme, finding solace and liberation in their embrace.

**Example:** Imagine a child completely trusting their parent, knowing they are loved and protected unconditionally. This pure, unwavering faith and surrender exemplify the essence of love for the divine.

Wrath is the\nmanifestation of the mode of ignoranc e; these modes exhibit themselves as\nwrath and other corollaries. If, therefor e, the mode of passion, instead of b eing\ndegraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by\nthe prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the\ndegradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead ex panded Himself into many for His\never-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of\nthis spiritual bliss. They also have part ial independence, but by misuse of their\nindependence, when the  service attitude is transformed into the propensity for\nsense enjoyment, they come under the sw ay of lust. This material creation is\ncreated by the Lord to give facility to  the conditioned souls to fulfill these\nlustful propensities, and when completely b affled by prolonged lustful\nactivities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Vedänta-sütras,  wherein it is said,\nathäto brahma jijïäsä : one should inquire into th e Supreme.

Ultimately, the plant takes shel ter under the lotus feet of Kåñëa and\nrests there. Gradually, as a plant grow s fruits and flowers, that plant of\ndevotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of\nchanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully\ndescribed in the Caitanya-caritämåta  (Madhya-lélä,  Chapter Nineteen ). It is\nexplained there that when the complete  plant takes shelter under the lotus\nfeet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he\ncannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme\nLord, just as a fish cannot live without water.

However, meditation, like a steady hand on a chariot's reins, allows us to gradually gain control over our thoughts and emotions.

Example: Imagine a lake disturbed by the wind. Its surface is covered in ripples, making it difficult to see what lies beneath. Meditation is like the wind calming down, allowing the surface of the lake to become still and reflect the clear sky above. This clarity allows us to see our true nature and connect with the Divine. 
","['have no value. That is more or  less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,\none should make research, by philosophi cal discretion, into the nature of the\nsoul. One should  make research to understand the self. That is recommended\nhere.\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga  is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul a nd the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti  conception, the devotional concepti on of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam,  as it is clearly stated. So\nbhakti,  or devotional service, is eternal. One  should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction.\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam.  “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute\nTruth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” B hagavän is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one shou ld reach up to that platform of\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge .\nBeginning from practicing humility up  to the point of realization of the\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of  Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground fl oor and going up to the top floor. Now\non this staircase there ar e so many people who have reached the first floor, the\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but un less one reaches the top floor, which is\nthe understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge.

**Meaning:** You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.

**Example:** A gardener tends to her plants with care and dedication. Whether her flowers bloom abundantly or a sudden storm ruins them is not in her control. Her true joy lies in nurturing the plants, not in the results she may or may not get. Similarly, find contentment in performing your duties with sincerity, without craving a specific outcome. This detachment will lead to gratitude and peace.

 ""entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires,\nbut the Lord is never responsible for th e actions and reactions of the particular\nsituati on which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the\nembodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and\nbecomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is\nthe constant companion of the l iving entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul,\nand therefore He can understand the desi res of the individual soul, as one can\nsmell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of\nconditioning for the living en tity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves:\nMan proposes and God disposes.

 'path of transcendence, fall away from both spiritual and material success and\nperish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?\nPURPORTCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int\'l. All Rights Reserved.There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest\nin transcendence; therefore they are mo re interested in material advancement\nby economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by\nappropriate work. When one takes to t he path of transcendence, one has to\ncease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material\nhappiness. If the aspiring transcendentalis t fails, then he apparently loses both\nways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness  nor spiritual\nsuccess. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky\nsometimes deviates from a small cloud an d joins a big one. But if it cannot join\na big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the\nvast sky. The brahmaëaù pathi  is the path of transcendental realization\nthrough knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the\nSupreme Lord, who is manifested as Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. Lord\nÇré Kåñëa is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and\ntherefore one who is surrendered to  the Supreme Person is a successful\ntranscendentalist. To reach this goal of life through Brahman and Paramätmä\nrealization takes many, many births ( bahünäà janmanäm ante  [Bg. 7.19]).\nTherefor e the supermost path of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga,  or\nKåñëa consciousness, the direct method.\nTEXT  39\nWTaNMae Sa&XaYa& k*-Z<a ^etauMahRSYaXaezTa"" )\nTvdNYa"" Sa&XaYaSYaaSYa ^etaa Na ùuPaPaÛTae )) 39 ))\netan me saàçayaà kåñëa\nchettum arhasy açeñataù\ntvad-anyaù saàçayasyäsya\nchettä na hy upapadyate\nSYNONYMS']",,,

Therefore, people in general keep this\nsame bodily idea in mind when they ar e informed of the personal form of the\nLord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material\nmanifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be\nimpersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception ofCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l. All Rights Reserved.retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When\nthey are informed that spiritual life is also i ndividual and personal, they\nbecome afraid of becoming persons again , and so they naturally prefer a kind\nof merging into the impersonal void . Generally, they compare the living\nentities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the\nhighest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual\npersonality. This is a kind of fearful st age of life, devoid of perfect knowledge\nof spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot\nunderstand spiritual existence a t all. Being embarrassed by so many theories\nand by contradictions of various type s of philosophical speculation, they\nbecome disgusted or angry and foolishl y conclude that there is no supreme\ncause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are i n a diseased\ncondition of life. Some people are too ma terially attached and therefore do not\ngive attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme\nspiritual cause, and some of them disbel ieve in everything, being angry at all\nsorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessn ess.

 'have no value. That is more or  less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä,\none should make research, by philosophi cal discretion, into the nature of the\nsoul. One should  make research to understand the self. That is recommended\nhere.\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that\nbhakti-yoga  is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion,\none must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual\nsoul. The individual soul a nd the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the\nbhakti  conception, the devotional concepti on of life. This service of the\nindividual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam,  as it is clearly stated. So\nbhakti,  or devotional service, is eternal. One  should be established in that\nphilosophical conviction.\nIn the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (1.2.11 ) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas\ntattvaà yaj jïänam advayam.  “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute\nTruth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman,\nParamätmä and Bhagavän.” B hagavän is the last word in the realization of the\nAbsolute Truth; therefore one shou ld reach up to that platform of\nunderstanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the\ndevotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge .\nBeginning from practicing humility up  to the point of realization of the\nSupreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of  Godhead, this process is just like a\nstaircase beginning from the ground fl oor and going up to the top floor. Now\non this staircase there ar e so many people who have reached the first floor, the\nsecond or the third floor, etc., but un less one reaches the top floor, which is\nthe understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge.

So,\nself-realization means understanding Kå ñëa and one’s eternal relationship with\nHim. The relationship of the living en tities with Kåñëa is also mentioned in\nthe Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä  (15.7). The living entities are parts and\nparcels of Kåñëa; therefore, revival of Kåñëa consciousness by the individual\nliving entity is the highest perfection al stage of Vedic knowledge. This is\nconfirmed in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam  (3.33.7 ) as follows:\naho bata çva-paco ’to garéyän\nyaj-jihvägre vartate näma tubhyam\ntepus tapas te juhuvuù sasnur äryä\nbrahmänücur näma gåëanti ye te\n“O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of aCopyright © 1998 The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Int'l.
