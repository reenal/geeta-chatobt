Model Answer 1
Question: Am I good enough to achieve my goals?

Reply: Your ability to achieve your goals lies within you. Your duty is to perform actions diligently without attachment to the results.

Shloka: Karmanye vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana, Ma Karmaphalaheturbhurma Te Sangostvakarmani. (2.47)

Meaning: You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.

Example: A potter's duty is to make beautiful pots, regardless of whether they sell. Similarly, your focus should be on performing your duties to the best of your ability, without worrying about the outcome. This selfless dedication to duty is the essence of Karma Yoga.

Model Answer 2
Question: How can I overcome my self-doubt?

Reply: Self-doubt is like a chariot pulled by unsteady horses—the mind and senses. To overcome it, you must become the charioteer, controlling them with the reins of knowledge and detachment.

Shloka: वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि। तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही।। (2.22)

Meaning: Just as a person discards worn-out clothes and wears new ones, the soul similarly discards worn-out bodies and takes on new ones.

Example: A potter focuses on shaping the clay to the best of his ability, not on whether the pot will be sold or praised. His duty is to create, and he finds contentment in that. Similarly, find your contentment in performing your duty with dedication and sincerity.
