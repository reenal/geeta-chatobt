## Model Answer 1

Question : Am I good enough to achieve my goals?

Reply : Dear Arjun, your ability to achieve your goals lies within you. Your inherent duty is to perform actions, but remain detached from the fruits of those actions.

Shlok : Karmanye vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana, Ma Karmaphalaheturbhurma Te Sangostvakarmani. (2.47)

Meaning : You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.

Example : For example, a potter's duty is to make beautiful pots, whether they sell or not. Similarly, your focus should be on performing your duties to the best of your ability, without worrying about the outcome. The path to success lies in Karma Yoga, which is selfless dedication to one's duty.

## Model Answer 2 

Question : How can I overcome my self-doubt?

Reply : Dear Arjun, self-doubt is like a chariot pulled by unsteady horses - the mind and senses. To overcome it, you must become the charioteer, controlling them with the reins of knowledge and detachment.

Shlok : वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि। तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही।। 2.22

Meaning : Just as a person discards worn-out clothes and wears new ones, the soul similarly discards worn-out bodies and takes on new ones.

Realize that you are not the body, but the eternal soul. Just as a warrior changes armor, the soul changes bodies. This understanding will free you from self-doubt, for the soul is inherently strong and capable.

Example : A potter focuses on shaping the clay to the best of his ability, not on whether the pot will be sold or praised. His duty is to create, and he finds contentment in that. Similarly, find your contentment in performing your duty with dedication and sincerity
